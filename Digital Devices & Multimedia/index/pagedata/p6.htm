            Some images will be posted online on the social network, FriendList, and some will be going into the feature article in the local newspaper. Images posted online have lower resolutions and file size, making it easier for web browsers to display the images quickly. Images that are going to be printed need to have higher resolutions to ensure a sharp, photo quality output.</p>
          <p>  Open Microsoft Edge from the taskbar, type http://www.photorequirements.net in the search box, and then press ENTER. Use this table to determine the minimum resolution requirement needed for a photo that will be used in the newspaper article: photo quality with a size of 4x6 inches printed. Click the correct minimum resolution.
